  <h1>Texdoc</h1>

  <p>Welcome. This is the homepage of the texdoc project. At least, it will be,
  as soon as I write it :-)</p>

  <p>For now, a few bits of information. The relevant mailing list to report
  bugs, request features, etc. is <a
   href="m&#x0061;ilto:texdoc&#x0040;tug.org">texdoc&#x0040;tug.org</a>. You can
  <a href="/mailman/listinfo/texdoc">subscribe</a> to the list to follow texdoc
  news and development, but you don't need to be subscribed to
  participate.</p>

  <h3>Known bugs</h3>

  <ul>
   <li>Problems with recent versions of Adobe Reader and Adobe Acrobat have been
   reported on Windows. Though the problem is not fully understood yet, a work
   around is known. It will be available with the regular updates via tlmgr from
   2008/09/12 (maybe 13 depending on the mirror's sync). You can also get it
   from this <a href="fix-texdoc-w32-ar9.zip">zip file</a>, to be unzipped in
   <code>TLROOT\bin\win32</code>.</li>

   <li>The original documentation, help message and man page point to the TeX
   Live mailing list, because the separate texdoc mailing list didn't exist when
   TL2008 was published. Now it is better to use the texdoc mailing list
   instead.</li>
  </ul>
