\section{Quick guide}

\subsection{Basics}

Open a command line\footnote{On windows, use ``Execute'' from the Start menu
  and type ©cmd©.  On Mac OS X, use the ``terminal'' icon on Mac OS X.  If you
  are using another flavour of Unix, you probably know what to do.} and type
©texdoc «name»©: the documentation of the ©«name»© package will pop up. Of
course, replace ©«name»© with the actual name of the package you want to learn
about. You can also look for the documentation of more than one package at
once: just give many names as arguments.

The rest of this section describes the most usual options, like how to
see all documentation related to a package or use a different viewer.

\subsection{Modes}

\texdoc has different modes that determine how results will be handled. The
default mode, called ``view'' mode, is to open the first (supposedly the best)
result in a viewer. It is rather handy when you know what you want to read,
and want to access it quickly. On the other hand, there may be other relevant
documents for the given ©«name»©, which are ignored in view mode.

The so-called ``list mode'' makes \texdoc list all relevant documentation and
ask you which one you want to view. It is useful when there a other
interesting sources of information besides the package's main documentation.

There is also a ``mixed'' mode, intended to combine the best of view mode and
list mode: if there is only one relevant result, then \texdoc opens it in a
viewer, else it offers you a menu.

Usually, \texdoc shows you only results it considers relevant. If there are no
``good'' results, it falls back to less relevant results. You can force
\texdoc to show you also ``bad'' results even when there are good ones by
using the ``showall'' mode. (This implies using a menu rather than starting a
viewer.)

You can select with command-line options: use ©texdoc «option» «name»© with
one of the following options: ©-w© or ©--view© for view mode, ©-m© or
©--mixed© for mixed mode, ©-l© or ©--list© for list mode, ©-s© or ©--showall©
for showall mode.

If you always (or mostly) use the same mode, it is probably easier to
select it in a configuration file than to always use the command-line
option. For this, see the next section.

\subsection{Configuration files}

\texdoc use various configuration files, which you can see using the ©-f© or
©--files© options. The second entry in this list is marked with a star ©(*)©:
it is the file you should use for your personal preferences as a user; you may
need to create it (and the parents directories).

In order to select you favorite mode, just insert a line ©mode = «yourmode»©
in this files, where ©«yourmode»© is one of ©view©, ©mixed©, ©list© or
©showall©.

The configuration files can be used to tweak \texdoc in many ways, the most
useful of which is probably the selection of the viewers for various types of
documents, explained in the next section.

\subsection{Viewers}

\texdoc's mechanism for choosing a viewer varies according to your platform.
On Windows and MacOS, it uses your file associations like when you
double-click files in the Explorer or the Finder (except for the text viewer,
which is always a pager). On Unix, it tries to find a viewer in the path from
a list of ``known' viewers.

You may want to select a different viewer for some kind of file. This is
achieved by the various ©viewer_«ext»© configuration options, where ©«ext»© is
the extension corresponding to the file type. For example, if you want to set
xpdf as your default PDF viewer, and run it in the background, insert the line
©viewer_pdf = xpdf %s &© in your configuration file. Here, ©%s© stands for the
name of the file to view.

\subsection{Conclusion}

We have now covered the most common needs. The next part explains
how \texdoc proceeds to find the best results.
The default configuration file tries hard to set appropriate values so that
you have a good out-of-the-box experience, but you may want to understand the
underlying mechanisms and adapt them to your needs. The final part is a full
reference for configuration options, including points omitted in the present
part.

  mailing list}. Feel free to post comments, bug reports, suggestions for
improvements (inc. new aliases), even without subscribing.

\section{File search, aliases, score}

\subsection{Basic concept}\label{ss-alias-basics}

The usual search modes of \texdoc assume that the name of the documentation
file is the name of the package, or contains it (at least in the directory
name).  However, this is not always true, due either to the author choosing a
fancy name, or packaging peculiarities.  To try helping the user to find the
doc even in these cases, \texdoc provides an alias mechanism and comes with a
list of circa 200 pre-defined aliases.

\begin{htcode}
  þ texdoc -l geometry þ
  texdoc info: geometry aliased to geometry/manual.pdf
  1 /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/geometry/manual.pdf
  Please enter the number of the file to view, anything else to skip: ¶0¶
\end{htcode}

The concept of alias is very\footnote{See~\ref{ss-alias-rem} for why it is
  actually \emph{too} simple.} simple: as you can see of the above example,
when you type and ©geometry© is aliased to ©geometry/manual.pdf©, then
everything happens as if you actually typed ©texdoc geometry/manual.pdf©
(without any further alias substitution), and \texdoc informs you that
something happened so you can understand the results
(see~\ref{cf-verbosity_level} to get rid of this message):

\begin{cmdsubsec}{Command line options}{ss-alias-cl}
  texdoc -a «options» «name»
  texdoc --alias «options» «name»
  texdoc -A «options» «name»
  texdoc --noalias «options» «name»
\end{cmdsubsec}

By default, aliased are used in view, list and mixed modes, and disabled in
search mode. But you may want to disable it, because the default alias doesn't
do what you want\footnote{In this case, please report it to
  \mailto{texdoc@tug.org}, so that the faulty alias can be updated.} or for
another reason.  In this case, you just have to add ©-A© or ©--noalias© to the
options, like:

\begin{htcode}
  þ texdoc -A -l geometry þ
  1 /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-doc/doc/polish/tex-virtual-academy-pl/
  latex2e/macro/geometry.html
  Please enter the number of the file to view, anything else to skip: ¶0¶
\end{htcode}

On the contrary, you can force aliasing in search mode by using the ©-a© or
©--alias© option, though it may not prove very useful.

\subsection{Your own aliases}\label{ss-alias-own}

You can define your own aliases, or override the default ones, in \texdoc's
configuration files. You can get a list of those files by typing ©texdoc -f©.
For personal aliases, it is recommended that you use the second file, marked
by a star (see~\ref{ss-prec} for details). You'll probably need to
create in and one or two of the directories containing it.

Creating an alias is easy: you just insert a line like 
\begin{htcode}
  alias geometry = geometry/manual.pdf
\end{htcode}
in your configuration file, and it's all.  You can have a look at the
configuration file provided (the last one showed by ©texdoc -f©) for examples.
If you want to permanently unalias something, just insert a line
©«name»=«name»©: it will overwrite the previous alias.

\section{Configuration reference}

\subsection{Precedence}\label{ss-prec}

Values for a particular setting can come from several sources. They are treated
in the following order, where first value found is always used:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Command-line options.
  \item Environment variables ending with ©_texdoc©.
  \item Other environment variables.
  \item Values from configuration files, read in the following order:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item ©TEXMFHOME/texdoc/texdoc-«platform».cnf©
      \item ©TEXMFHOME/texdoc/texdoc.cnf©
      \item ©TEXMFHOME/texdoc/texdoc-dist.cnf©
      \item ©TEXMFLOCAL/texdoc/texdoc-«platform».cnf©
      \item ©TEXMFLOCAL/texdoc/texdoc.cnf©
      \item ©TEXMFMAIN/texdoc/texdoc.cnf©
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Hard-coded defaults that may depend on the current platform or the
    current value of another setting.
\end{enumerate}

For the configuration files, ©«platform»© stands for the name of the current
platform, with names matching those of the directories in ©TEXLIVEROOT/bin©,
and ©TEXMFHOME© and others are the kpse's values, see the kpathsea and web2c
manuals. The name with ©«platform»© can be used on installation shared between
many machines where, for example, not the same viewers are available. However,
their use is not recommended in other situations. Finally, the special file
©texdoc-dist.cnf© allows you to install a newer version of \texdoc (including
its default config file) in your home: see \href{http://tug.org/texdoc/}{the
  web page} for instructions on running \texdoc from the SVN.

\subsection{Command-line options}\label{ss-cl}

Most of the command-line options correspond to an option that can be set from
the config files. For them, we refer the reader to the description of the
corresponding configuration option. 

\begin{cmdsubsub}{-h, --help}{cl-h}
  -h, --help
\end{cmdsubsub}

Shows a quick help message (namely a list of command-line options) and exits
successfully.

\begin{cmdsubsub}{-V, --version}{cl-v}
  -V, --version
\end{cmdsubsub}

Show the current version of the program and exits successfully.

\begin{cmdsubsub}{-f, --files}{cl-f}
  -f, --files
\end{cmdsubsub}

Shows the list of the configuration files for the current installation and
platform, with their status (active or not found) and a star marking the
recommended file for user settings.

\begin{cmdsubsub}{-w, -l, -m, -s, -r, --view, --list, --mixed, --search,
    --regex}{cl-mode}
  -w, --view, -l, --list, -m, --mixed, -s, --search, -r, --regex
\end{cmdsubsub}

See~\ref{cf-mode}.

\begin{cmdsubsub}{-a, -A, --alias, --noalias}{cl-a}
  -a, --alias, -A, --noalias
\end{cmdsubsub}

See~\ref{s-alias}.

\begin{cmdsubsub}{-i, -I, --interact, --nointeract}{cl-i}
  -i, --interact, -I, --nointeract
\end{cmdsubsub}

See~\ref{cf-interact}.

\begin{cmdsubsub}{-e, --extensions}{cl-e}
  -e=«l», --extensions=«l»
\end{cmdsubsub}

See~\ref{cf-ext_list}.  \emph{But} be aware that on the command line there
should be no space at all, neither in the list (unless quoted according to you
shell's convention) not between the ©-e© or ©--extension© option, the equal
sign, and the list.  Also take care to quote the special value ©*© if
necessary.  The equal sign is optional.

\begin{cmdsubsub}{-v, --verbosity, -d, --debug}{cl-n}
  -v=«n», --verbosity=«n», -d, --debug
\end{cmdsubsub}

See~\ref{cf-verbosity_level} and be aware that you must avoid spaces on the
command line, and the ©=© sign is optional. The ©--debug© option sets
verbosity at the maximum level.

\subsection{Environment variables}\label{ss-envvar}

They all correspond to some ©viewer_«ext»© setting, and the reader is referred
to~\ref{s-viewer} and~\ref{cf-viewer_*} for details. Also, environment
variables used by older versions of \texdoc are accepted. You can append
©_texdoc© to every name in the first column: this wins over every other name.

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{@{}l*3{@{ }l}@{}}
    New name    & Old name 1        & Old name 2           & Config. param.\\
    ©PAGER©     & ©TEXDOCVIEW_txt©  & ©TEXDOC_VIEWER_TXT©  & ©viewer_txt©  \\
    ©BROWSER©   & ©TEXDOCVIEW_html© & ©TEXDOC_VIEWER_HTML© & ©viewer_html© \\
    ©DVIVIEWER© & ©TEXDOCVIEW_dvi©  & ©TEXDOC_VIEWER_DVI©  & ©viewer_dvi©  \\
    ©PSVIEWER©  & ©TEXDOCVIEW_ps©   & ©TEXDOC_VIEWER_PS©   & ©viewer_ps©   \\
    ©PDFVIEWER© & ©TEXDOCVIEW_pdf©  & ©TEXDOC_VIEWER_PDF©  & ©viewer_pdf©  \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Configuration files}\label{ss-conf}

\subsubsection{General structure}\label{sss-sonf-struct}

Configuration files are line-oriented text files. Comments begin with a ©#©
and run to the end of line. Lines containing only space are ignored. Space at
the beginning or end of a line, as well as around an ©=© sign, is ignored.
Apart from comments and empty lines, each line must be of one of the following
forms:

\begin{htcode}
  «config_param» = «value»
  alias «name» = «target»
\end{htcode}

where ©«config_parameter»© consists of only letters, digits or ©-© signs,
©«name»© of letters, digits, ©-© and ©_© signs. ©«value»© and ©«target»© are
free strings (except that not every ©«value»© is valid for every
©«config_param»©, see below) and nothing in it need not be quoted (actually,
quotes will be interpreted as part of the value, not as quotation marks).

Lines which do not obey these rules raise a warning. However, unrecognised
values of ©«config_param»© raise no warning at the moment.

The ©«value»© is usually interpreted as a string, except when ©«config_param»©
ends with:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item ©_list©, then ©«value»© is a coma-separated list of strings. Space
    around commas is ignored. Two consecutive comas or a coma at the beginning
    or end of the list means the empty string at the corresponding place.
  \item ©_switch©, then ©«value»© must be either ©true© or ©false©
    (case-sensitive).
  \item ©_level©, then ©«value»© is a non-negative integer.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{cmdsubsub}{mode}{cf-mode}
  mode = «view, list, mixed, search, regex»
\end{cmdsubsub}
Set the  mode to the given value.  Default is ©view©.  The first three values
©view©, ©list©, ©mixed© use the same searching method: first search a file
whose name is the ©«name»© on the command line and whose extension is in
©ext_list© (see~\ref{cf-ext_list}), and if nothing is found, then do a full
search.  This means that a file matches if ©«name»© is a substring of its
path+name (and its extension is in the list). Here path does not mean the full
path, but only the part below ©TEXMF/doc©. The ©search© mode forces a full
search.

The last mode, ©regex©, looks for ©«name»© in the path+filename as a Lua
regex.  If you don't know Lua regexes you should be aware that the escape
character is ©%© and the ©-© sign is a special character (which means the same
as ©*?© in Perl regexes).  For more details, see the Lua
\href{http://www.lua.org/manual/}{reference manual} or the book
\href{http://www.lua.org/pil/}{\emph{programming in Lua}}.  You might want to
use\footnote{The quotes in the example are just to make the shell happy.}
©-e='*'© if your regex uses the ©$© anchor.%stopzone

\begin{cmdsubsub}{interact}{cf-interact}
  interact_switch = «true, false»
\end{cmdsubsub}

Turn on or off interaction.  Default is on.  Turning interaction off prevents
\texdoc to ask you to choose a file to view when there are multiple choices,
and merely just print the list of files found.

\begin{cmdsubsub}{ext_list}{cf-ext_list}
  ext_list = «list»
\end{cmdsubsub}

Set the list of recognised extensions to ©«list»©.  Default is
\begin{htcode}
  pdf, html, txt, dvi, ps,
\end{htcode}
This list is used to filter and  sort the results (with the default value: pdf
first, etc).  Two special values are recognised:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{The empty element}. This means files without extensions, or more
    precisely without a dot in their name.  This is meant for files like
    ©README©, etc.  The file is assumed to be plain text for viewing purpose.
  \item ©*© means any extension.  Of course if it is present in the list, it
    can be the only element!
\end{itemize}

There is a very special case: if the searched ©«name»© has ©.sty© extension,
\texdoc enters a special search mode for ©.sty© files (not located in the same
place as real documentation files) for this ©«name»©, independantly of the
current value of ©ext_list© and ©mode© (unless it is the ©regex© mode). In an
ideal world, this wouldn't be necessary since every sty file would have a
proper documentation in pdf, html or plain text, but\dots

For each ©«ext»© in ©ext_list© there should be a corresponding
©viewer_«ext»© value set.  Defaults are defined corresponding to the default
©ext_list©, but you can add values if you want.  For example, if you want
\texdoc to be able to find man pages and display them with the ©man© command,
you can use
\begin{htcode}
  ext_list = 1, 5, pdf, html, txt, dvi, ps,
  viewer_1 = man
  viewer_5 = man
\end{htcode}
(This also makes man pages in man format take precedence over their pdf
versions.)

\begin{cmdsubsub}{viewer_*}{cf-viewer_*}
  viewer_«ext» = «cmd»
\end{cmdsubsub}

Set the viewer command for files with extension ©«ext»© to ©«cmd»©. For files
without extension, ©viewer_txt© is used, and there's not ©viewer_© variable.
In ©«cmd»©, ©%s© can be used as a placeholder for the file name, which is
otherwise inserted at the end of the command.  The command can be a arbitrary
shell construct. 

\begin{cmdsubsub}{alias}{cf-alias}
  alias «name» = «othername»
\end{cmdsubsub}

Everything has already been said in section~\ref{s-alias}.

\begin{cmdsubsub}{verbosity_level}{cf-verbosity_level}
  verbosity_level = «n»
\end{cmdsubsub}

Set the verbosity level to ©«n»©.  This determines whether \texdoc will print
or not errors or debug information (to stderr). Default level is 3. The
numeric codes are as follow:
\begin{enumerate}[start=0]
  \item Print nothing (not recommended).
  \item Print only error messages.
  \item Also print warnings.
  \item Also print information messages.
  \item[n] Also print debug(n-3) information messages.
\end{enumerate}

Currently, debug goes from 1 to 3 : ©debug1© prints the command used to view a
file just before executing it, ©debug2© prints information about setting
configuration paramters, and ©debug3© about the search paths used.

\begin{cmdsubsub}{lastfile_switch}{cf-lastfile_switch}
  lastfile_switch = «true, false»
\end{cmdsubsub}

Prevents \texdoc from reading any other configuration file after this one.
Mainly useful for installing a newer version of \texdoc in your home (see the
\href{http://tug.org/texdoc/}{web site} for instructions on how to do so).

\subsection{Exit codes}\label{ss-exit}

The current exit code are as follow:
\begin{enumerate}[start=0]
  \item Success.
  \item Syntax error.
  \item Documentation not found for at least one argument.
\end{enumerate}
