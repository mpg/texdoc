This readme explains what the documentation is, it is not part of the
documentation itself.

The two sources are:
1. doc/texdoc.tex
2. texdoc.tlu (the usage string)

From there are generated:
1. The real user manual in pdf format: texdoc.pdf
2. The minimal man page in man(1), pdf and html format: texdoc.1{,.html,.pdf}

See the Makefile for details.
