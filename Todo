Small items
===========

Turn the suffixes list in score.tlu into a config item. Is a prefix list needed?

Big stuff planned
=================

Make the necessary arrangements for shipping metadata with texdoc on TL.
    - adjust the code so that it loads the file just before reading the actual
      tlpdb
    - write some script or anything to have this generated (see "downstream")

Downstream: arrange for downstream distros to have the tlpinfo too.
    - write some script to generate a "cache" to ship with texdoc
    - adjust the code for using it if no tlpdb file is found
    - fix Docfile.realpath for this. Problems with 'texmf-dist/doc' in the name
      of the file, too.

Write doc for this, esp. output format of -M.

Write a script for alias validation (write it in Lua using the texdoc code,
trying to reverse engineer the score results from a Perl script is too hard and
too likely to break). Goals:
1. detect aliases that don't give results
2. detect which aliases are useless in that they don't change the (first, or list
  of) results
Looks like 2 is a superset of 1, isn't it?

Write a coverage checking script? What would be its exact goals? May want to
discuss this with Phlipp S.

Misc ideas
==========

tlpdb cache should check if ext_list has change, in theory. Is it worth it in
practice?

Caching: now used only for tlpdb. Is it worth using it for ls-R files?
Configuration files?

Add support for shell-style globs (standard regex is probably too hard)
    Well, would anyone really use it? (would be for patterns in texdoc.cnf, not
    for texdoc arguments)

Write or use some GNU-like getopt_long
-> alt-getopt looks ok

Ideas for later
===============

Using the catalogue
-------------------

Use language information from the catalogue/tlpdb. (Next big item after the
search stuff.) If no lang info from catalogue, might try guessing based on
filename, but is it worth it?

Obsolescence information could be useful (Phil's suggestion), but may be hard to
obtain (not in the tlpdb)...

Do something with the description from the catalogue?

Help maintainers standardise comments in order to allow for more accurate
scoring/classification?

Port on MikTeX ???
------------------

Lots of TeX-live specific stuff (implicitly) embedded in various places...

Add a function in texlua's kpse library returning all files for which a certain
Lua function (given as argument) returns true. Use only it.

What to do with all the functions using tlpdb coming? Is it possible to use an
equivalent on MikTeX?

Adapt to the different tree layout in MikTeX (TEXMFHOME etc don't exist).

May maintain two versions as branches?
