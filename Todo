Stuff to do soon
================

Use alt-getopt for options parsing.

Turn the suffixes list in score.tlu into a config item. Is a prefix list needed?

Document --just-view.

Metadata problems
-----------------

Maybe a problem in TL's infra: no meta for ec's readme.

Meta missing with beebe's files.

Check meta with bezos package.

No comment for beameruserguide.

Fixes in the catalogue are slow to propagate to TL.  Should the shipped meta
file be generated direclty from the catalogue?

Code cleanup
------------

Adapt the alias structure to remember which one is the original. Then, the
kpse-like search routine can select only exact matches for this one. Also, the
scoring routine wouldn't need the original keyword as an argument anymore. Then
the Docfile object could have a .score virtual member.

Get rid of my load_env/export_symbols paranoia. Use standard module() thing,
plus locals.

Syntax simplifictation in some places using object-oriented syntax for strings?

Ideas for later
===============

Not sure about that
-------------------

Use language information from the catalogue/tlpdb. If no lang info from
catalogue, might try guessing based on filename, but is it worth it? The problem
is, how would it interact with the socring system? Would a +3 bonus for good
language be OK?

Write a coverage checking script? What would be its exact goals? May want to
discuss this with Phlipp S.

tlpdb cache should check if ext_list has changed, in theory. Is it worth it in
practice? I'll do it if someone complains...

Caching: now used only for tlpdb. Is it worth using it for ls-R files?
Configuration files?

Add support for shell-style globs (standard regex is probably too hard)
    Well, would anyone really use it? (would be for patterns in texdoc.cnf, not
    for texdoc arguments)

Use the 2-links trick from kpse when exploring trees? Check how it works on
windows.

Using the catalogue
-------------------

Obsolescence information could be useful (Phil's suggestion), but may be hard to
obtain (not in the tlpdb)... Well, if it's in the catalogue, I can ship a
Data.obsolete.lua file with the information...

Do something with the description from the catalogue?

Help maintainers standardise comments in order to allow for more accurate
scoring/classification?

Port on MikTeX ???
------------------

Lots of TeX-live specific stuff (implicitly) embedded in various places...

Add a function in texlua's kpse library returning all files for which a certain
Lua function (given as argument) returns true. Use only it.

What to do with all the functions using tlpdb? Is it possible to use an
equivalent on MikTeX?

Adapt to the different tree layout in MikTeX (TEXMFHOME etc don't exist).

May maintain two versions as branches???
