Stuff to do soon
================

Use alt-getopt for options parsing.
Done, but:
- alt-getopt doesn't use error(), so pcall() doesn't work :-(
- no optional arguments (old-style -v)

Turn the suffixes list in score.tlu into a config item. Is a prefix list needed?

Use texlive/tlpdb.tlu for tlpdb reading.

Use language information from the catalogue/tlpdb. If no lang info from
catalogue, might try guessing based on filename, but is it worth it?

Ideas for later
===============

Not sure about that
-------------------

Information from the tlpdb isn't always as up-to-date as the catalogue, in case
the catalogue has been fixed for a package that wasn't update. Should I generate
Data.meta.lua directly from a fresh catalogue version?

For non-original patterns (ie actual aliases), the kpse-like search routines
should select only exact matches.

Write a coverage checking script? What would be its exact goals? May want to
discuss this with Phlipp S.

tlpdb cache should check if ext_list has changed, in theory. Is it worth it in
practice? I'll do it if someone complains...

Caching: now used only for tlpdb. Is it worth using it for ls-R files?
Configuration files?

Add support for shell-style globs (standard regex is probably too hard)
    Well, would anyone really use it? (would be for patterns in texdoc.cnf, not
    for texdoc arguments)

Use the 2-links trick from kpse when exploring trees? Check how it works on
windows.

Using the catalogue
-------------------

Obsolescence information could be useful (Phil's suggestion), but may be hard to
obtain (not in the tlpdb)... Well, if it's in the catalogue, I can ship a
Data.obsolete.lua file with the information...

Do something with the description from the catalogue?

Help maintainers standardise comments in order to allow for more accurate
scoring/classification?

Port on MikTeX ???
------------------

Lots of TeX-live specific stuff (implicitly) embedded in various places...

Add a function in texlua's kpse library returning all files for which a certain
Lua function (given as argument) returns true. Use only it.

What to do with all the functions using tlpdb? Is it possible to use an
equivalent on MikTeX?

Adapt to the different tree layout in MikTeX (TEXMFHOME etc don't exist).

May maintain two versions as branches???
