Small items
===========

Turn the suffixes list in score.tlu into a config item. Is a prefix list needed?

Big stuff planned
=================

Review/update doc.

Write a script for alias validation (write it in Lua using the texdoc code,
trying to reverse engineer the score results from a Perl script is too hard and
too likely to break). Goals:
1. detect aliases that don't give results
2. detect which aliases are useless in that they don't change the (first, or list
  of) results
3. special-case for .sty aliases: they are ok only if there is no other result.
Looks like 2 is a superset of 1, isn't it?

Write a coverage checking script? What would be its exact goals? May want to
discuss this with Phlipp S.

Misc ideas
==========

tlpdb cache should check if ext_list has changed, in theory. Is it worth it in
practice? I'll do it if someone complains...

Caching: now used only for tlpdb. Is it worth using it for ls-R files?
Configuration files?

Add support for shell-style globs (standard regex is probably too hard)
    Well, would anyone really use it? (would be for patterns in texdoc.cnf, not
    for texdoc arguments)

Write or use some GNU-like getopt_long
-> alt-getopt looks ok

[internal] Adapt the alias structure to remember which one is the original. Then, the
skpse-like search routine can select only exact matches for this one. Also, the
scoring routine wouldn't need the original keyword as an argument anymore. Then
the Docfile object could have a .score virtual member.

Ideas for later
===============

Using the catalogue
-------------------

Use language information from the catalogue/tlpdb. (Next big item after the
search stuff.) If no lang info from catalogue, might try guessing based on
filename, but is it worth it?

Obsolescence information could be useful (Phil's suggestion), but may be hard to
obtain (not in the tlpdb)...

Do something with the description from the catalogue?

Help maintainers standardise comments in order to allow for more accurate
scoring/classification?

Port on MikTeX ???
------------------

Lots of TeX-live specific stuff (implicitly) embedded in various places...

Add a function in texlua's kpse library returning all files for which a certain
Lua function (given as argument) returns true. Use only it.

What to do with all the functions using tlpdb? Is it possible to use an
equivalent on MikTeX?

Adapt to the different tree layout in MikTeX (TEXMFHOME etc don't exist).

May maintain two versions as branches???
