Small items
===========

Turn the suffixes list in score.tlu into a config item. Is a prefix list needed?

Big stuff planned
=================

Decide how and when tlpdb search should happen (performance issues).
    - if tlpdb is found, use it.
        - adapt texlive/tlpdb.tlu to be usable (error handling). If the cache
          thing works, use it. Otherwise, compare performance with my own
        version.
    - otherwise, use a pre-hashed database (write a script to prepare it,
      ship it with TL: useless here but then downstream distros will get it).
    - see "caching" in the ideas section.

Use meta-data from the tlpdb for scoring.
    - Idea: make the default score negetive, (-5 could do). Then all docfiles
      with a tlpdb-style match only get a 0 score if they have metadata, unless
    the metadata string contains details="readme (case-insensitive)
    - exclude bundles (a hard-coded list of bundles would be ok, but perhaps
      putting it in texdoc.cnf is cleaner) This may not be needed, depending on
    how the scoring is made.

Think about the output format for metadata.

Write doc for this, esp. output format of -M.

Once the search changes are done, make sure that each "real" .sty file gets a
result with score >= 0. Write a script checking for that with an exclusion list
(eg beamertheme*.sty). At this point, see:
http://tug.org/mailman/htdig/tex-live/2009-October/023395.html

Write a script for alias validation (write it in Lua using the texdoc code,
trying to reverse engineer the score results from a Perl script is too hard and
too likely to break).

Misc ideas
==========

Add caching support Ã  la ConTeXt-fonts? Could be useful for files which are long
to read, like tlpdb. (Would also simplify the distribution of a pre-hashed db
for downstream distros, and make the "custom code vs standard module for tlpdb
reading" dilemna disappear.) Would work as follows:
    1. look for a cache in TEXMFVAR/some/location/to/be/determined
        The cache could be a precompiled Lua file (.tlc).
    2. If non-existent or older than the reference files (texlive.tlpdb or
    various ls-R files, regenerate, else use it.
Need to determine:
- whether this is useful: at all, for tlpdb, for ls-R files...
- what to do with unindexed directories if caching is used?
Add a debug section for this.

add support for shell-style globs (standard regex is probably too hard)
    Well, would anyone really use it? (would be for patterns in texdoc.cnf, not
    for texdoc arguments)

write or use some GNU-like getopt_long

Ideas for later
===============

Using the catalogue
-------------------

Use language information from the catalogue/tlpdb. (Next big item after the
search stuff.)

Obsolescence information could be useful (Phil's suggestion), but may be hard to
obtain (not in the tlpdb)...

Do something with the description from the catalogue?

Help maintainers standardise comments in order to allow for more accurate
scoring/classification?

Port on MikTeX ???
------------------

Lots of TeX-live specific stuff (implicitly) embedded in various places...

Add a function in texlua's kpse library returning all files for which a certain
Lua function (given as argument) returns true. Use only it.

What to do with all the functions using tlpdb coming? Is it possible to use an
equivalent on MikTeX?

Adapt to the different tree layout in MikTeX (TEXMFHOME etc don't exist).

May maintain two versions as branches?
