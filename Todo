Bug reported by Denis

Should to review extensively case-sensitivity issues (alias, matches, etc.)

Add a scoring option to the alias directive?

Big stuff planned
=================

Decide how and when tlpdb search should happen (performance issues).

Use meta-data from the tlpdb for scoring (eg 'Package documentation' should get
a good score). Porbably need to standardise comments with the catalogue
maintainers.

Once the search changes are done, make sure that each "real" .sty file gets a
result with score >= 0. Write a script checking for that with an exclusion list
(eg beemertheme*.sty). At this point, see:

Misc ideas
==========

add support for shell-style globs (standard regex is probably too hard)

write or use some GNU-like getopt_long

display info from the tlpdb?

Ideas for later
===============

Using the catalogue
-------------------

Use language information from the catalogue/tlpdb.

Obsolescence information could be useful (Phil's suggestion).

Do something with the description from the catalogue?

Port on MikTeX
--------------

Add a function in texlua's kpse library returning all files for which a certain
Lua function (given as argument) returns true. Use only it.

Adapt to the different tree layout in MikTeX (TEXMFHOME etc don't exist).

May maintain two versions as branches?
