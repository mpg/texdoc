Small todo items
================

- bug reported by Denis

Big changes planned
===================

Need to review extensively case-sensitivity issues (alias, matches, etc.)

Also search using info from the tlpdb (use docfiles associated with a given
runfile -- see if it causes more harm than good for bundles).

Add a scoring option to the alias directive.

Misc ideas
==========

add support for shell-style globs (standard regex is probably too hard)

write or use some GNU-like getopt_long

display info from the tlpdb?

Ideas for later
===============

Using the catalogue
-------------------

Derive aliases and categories from the catalogue information.

Use language information from the catalogue.

Obsolescence information could be useful (Phil's suggestion).

Do something with the description from the catalogue?

Port on MikTeX
--------------

Add a function in texlua's kpse library returning all files for which a certain
Lua function (given as argument) returns true. Use only it.

Adapt to the different tree layout in MikTeX (TEXMFHOME etc don't exist).

May maintain two versions as branches?

Coverage
--------

Once the search changes are done, make sure that each "real" .sty file gets a
result with score >= 0. Write a script checking for that with an exclusion list
(eg beemertheme*.sty). At this point, see:
