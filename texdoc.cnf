# star; you may need to create it.  DO NOT copy the present file, please
# create a new one (you may want to copy/paste/edit portions of the present

#
# For system-wide configuration or other uses, you may want to use the other

# General settings
# ================

## Viewers

# Defaults depend on what is available on your system, as well as your desktop
# environment. Here are a few examples.
#
# %s is optional and stands for the filename.
#
# viewer_pdf = xpdf             # works
# viewer_pdf = xpdf %s &        # works even better

# If you want to enable support for zipped documentation (see below),
# you may want to adapt viewer_* so that it starts a subshell:
#
# viewer_pdf = (xpdf %s) &
#
# Otherwise, the & will have no effect since the viewing command is followed by
# some cleanup-commands for temporary files. For the same reason, %s must be the
# last thing on your command line: (xpdf %s -option) will not work.
#
# WARNING: for zip support your viewer needs to be blocking, i.e. it must not
# return immediately: otherwise the temporary file will be deleted too early.

## Zipped documentation support

# WARNING: support for zipped documents works only on Unix. Make sure that the
# values of the associated options are adapted to your system.  Read the above
# warning concerning viewers.

# Built-in defaults (for reference):
#
# zipext_list   =       # (empty list)
# rm_file       = rm -f
# rm_dir        = rmdir
#
# For each "ext" in zipext_list, you must define a "unzip_ext" unzipper.
# The unzipped data must be printed on stdout. Example:
#
# zipext_list = gz
# unzip_gz    = gzip -d -c

## User interaction

# Built-in defaults (for reference):
#
# mode             = view
#
# interact_switch  = true
# machine_switch   = false
#
# verbosity_level  = 2  # Print: 0: nothing, 1: errors, 2: warnings, 3: infos
# debug_list       =    # the empty list

## Documentation searching

# Built-in defaults (for reference):
#
# ext_list    = pdf, htm, html, txt, ps, dvi,  # Note: empty string at end
# badext_list = txt,                           # Note: empty string at end
# basename_list    = readme
# badbasename_list = readme

# Known suffixes for documentation
suffix_list = doc, -doc, _doc, .doc, /doc, manual, /manual, -manual, userguide, /user_guide, -guide, -user, -man, notes


# Score adjustments
# =================

# Results are sorted by score (decreasing).
# Only results with positive scores are displayed (unless mode is 'showall').
# Results with score <= -100 are never displayed.
#
# The score of results containing a given pattern can be adjusted using the
# 'adjscore' directive, either globally or only for specific queries.  It is
# also possible to set the score directly in alias directives, see the next
# section.
#
# As a general rule, use 'adjscore' if you only want to adjust the score of
# particular results, and 'alias' if you want to add new results (possibly
# adjusting their score) for a particular query.
#
# To override one of the settings below, use the 'noadjscore' directive in
# your personal configuration file, see the manual for details.

## General adjustments

# Makefile are never documentation, just as documents in src or source subdir
# -1000 should be enough to kill them
adjscore /Makefile = -1000
adjscore /src/     = -1000
adjscore /source/  = -1000

# licence files aren't very likely to contain relevant documentation, but it
# feels wrong to totally kill them
adjscore copying = -10
adjscore license = -10
adjscore gpl     = -10

# tex-virtual-academy provides a lot of spurious matches
adjscore /tex-virtual-academy-pl/ = -50

# test and example files are not likely the best documentation
adjscore test    = -3
adjscore example = -3
adjscore sample  = -3

# readme's usually get a negative score because they have a bad extension,
# but they're still slightly better than other results with negative scores
adjscore readme = 0.1

# uncomment this to make the man pages have a greater priority
#adjscore .man1. = 5
#adjscore .man5. = 5

## Specific adjustments

# 'texdoc' may look like "tex's documentation" but it isn't
# similar problem with 'tex-*'
adjscore(tex) texdoc   = -10
adjscore(tex) tex-gyre = -10
adjscore(tex) tex-ps   = -10

# avoid too many results to be shown for 'latex'
# package names
adjscore(latex) cjw-latex                  = -10
adjscore(latex) cweb-latex                 = -10

adjscore(latex) example_latex              = -10
adjscore(latex) test_latex                 = -10

# beamer
adjscore(beamer) beamer-tut-pt/tutorialbeamer = +10
adjscore(beamer) beamer-FUBerlin              = -3
adjscore(beamer) beamer-tut-pt                = -10
adjscore(beamer) presentations                = -10

# misc
adjscore(context) circuitikz = -10
adjscore(symbols) /staves/   = -5


# Aliases
# =======

# Aliases allow to add results for a specific query, by making texdoc search
# for additional keywords in the file name. Matches for the new keyword get a
# very high score by default, but this can be adjusted.
#
# To override one of the settings below, use the 'noalias' directive in
# your personal configuration file, see the manual for details.
