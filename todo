- change the alias behaviour, alias should be like addalias

- find a solution to the man vs info with same filename dilemma: rename the man
  pages as .1.pdf and make texdoc find them (change the search routine for that)

- choose an alias for xetex-ref

- make the search routine ignore the first components of the path (eg /latex/)?

- add support for shell-style globs (standard regex is probably too hard)

- include the output of --files in verbosity level 4

- detect unkown options in config files

- write or use some GNU-like getopt_long

- at some verbosity level, tell where does a particular setting come from
