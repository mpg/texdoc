- add an extra level of personal texdoc.cnf (like ~/.texdoc.cnf) to allow
  running from svn

- find a solution to the man vs info with same filename dilemma:
	- first find out how many files are concerned, then either
	(a) use aliases to disambiguate
	(b) rename the man pages as .1.pdf and make texdoc find them by either
	adding aliases or making it search function smarter

- choose an alias for xetex-ref

- make texdoc case insensitive on all platforms?

- make the search routine ignore the first (two) components of the path (eg
  doc/xelatex)?
