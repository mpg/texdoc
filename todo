- change the alias behaviour, alias should be like addalias (add a priority
  level?)

- find a solution to the man vs info with same filename dilemma: rename the man
  pages as .1.pdf and make texdoc find them (change the search routine for that)

- make the search routine ignore the first components of the path (eg /latex/)?

- add support for shell-style globs (standard regex is probably too hard)

- write or use some GNU-like getopt_long

- display info from the tlpdb (see thread on tldev)

- make the display of the list of files independant of interact_switch value

- maybe investigate the problem with AR 5.0.5 (Phil T., TL list, 2009/07/03)

- make fonttable/fonttable.pdf win over anything/fonttable.pdf

Notes for using the Catalogue (later)
-------------------------------------

Obsolescence information could be useful (Phil's suggestion).
